# AI Phat Controller - Development Roadmap

This document outlines a phased approach to address all identified issues and complete planned features.

> **Note**: The project has moved from Electron desktop app to plain Node.js server as the primary run mode (v1.4.0+). Phases 0-2 and 4 are substantially complete. Docker remains supported as an alternative deployment.
