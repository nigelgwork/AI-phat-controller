 * Executor module - handles running Claude Code and other commands

 * This file re-exports from the implementation for backwards compatibility.
 * The actual implementation is in executor-impl.ts

 * Structure:
 * - executor/types.ts - Type definitions
 * - executor/utils.ts - Shared utilities
 * - executor-impl.ts - Main executor implementations (WindowsExecutor, WslExecutor)
 * - executor.ts - Re-exports (this file)
